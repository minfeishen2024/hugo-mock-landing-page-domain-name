# A Mock Landing Page for InkSMITH

## Note for Custom Domain Access
For the CSS style to display correctly, I had to manually type in `http://reads.africa/`, which is the address in the settings of my github pages. Simply navigating to reads.africa goes to the `https://reads.africa/` which has incorrect css. For some reason, my website does not start with https even when I followed the instruction.
